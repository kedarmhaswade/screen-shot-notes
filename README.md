# screen-shot-notes
Learning is what most of us in general and knowledge workers in particular must do and enjoy. Reading and writing is one form of learning. But how about learning from audio-visual resources? I decided to give "taking notes" while learning audio-visually a try. These are merely my notes from audio-visual content on the web taken via screen-shots. Instead of taking text notes from a video presentation (live or prerecorded) as I am following it, I decided to take screen-shots and stick them up here. This is clearly for my personal benefit more than anything else.

Of course this is, like many other endeavors of mine, an experiment. Let us see if I am able to learn, enjoy, and retain better with this new technique.
